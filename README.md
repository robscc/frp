## What can I do with frp?

* Expose any http and https service behind a NAT or firewall to the internet by a server with public IP address(Name-based Virtual Host Support).
* Expose any tcp service behind a NAT or firewall to the internet by a server with public IP address.
* Inspect all http requests/responses that are transmitted over the tunnel(future).

## Status

frp is under development and you can try it with latest release version. Master branch for releasing stable version when dev branch for developing.

**We may change any protocol and can't promise backward compatible. Please check the release log when upgrading.**

## Architecture

![architecture](/doc/pic/architecture.png)

## Example Usage

Firstly, download the latest programs from [Release](https://github.com/robscc/frp/releases) page according to your os and arch.

Put **frps** and **frps.ini** to your server with public IP.

Put **frpc** and **frpc.ini** to your server in LAN.

### Communicate with your computer in LAN by SSH

1. Modify frps.ini, configure a reverse proxy named [ssh]:

  ```ini
  # frps.ini
  [common]
  bind_port = 7000

  [ssh]
  listen_port = 6000
  auth_token = 123
  ```

2. Start frps:

  `./frps -c ./frps.ini`

3. Modify frpc.ini, set remote frps's server IP as x.x.x.x:

  ```ini
  # frpc.ini
  [common]
  server_addr = x.x.x.x
  server_port = 7000
  auth_token = 123

  [ssh]
  type = tcp
  local_ip = 127.0.0.1
  local_port = 22
  ```

4. Start frpc:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.ini`

5. Connect to server in LAN by ssh assuming that username is test:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 test@x.x.x.x`

### Visit your web service in LAN by custom domains

Sometimes we want to expose a local web service behind a NAT network to others for testing with your own domain name and unfortunately we can't resolve a domain name to a local ip.

However, we can expose a http or https service using frp.

1. Modify frps.ini, configure a http reverse proxy named [web] and set http port as 8080, custom domain as `www.yourdomain.com`:

  ```ini
  # frps.ini
  [common]
  bind_port = 7000
  vhost_http_port = 8080

  [web]
  type = http
  custom_domains = www.yourdomain.com
  auth_token = 123
  ```

2. Start frps:

  `./frps -c ./frps.ini`

3. Modify frpc.ini and set remote frps server's IP as x.x.x.x. The `local_port` is the port of your web service:

  ```ini
  # frpc.ini
  [common]
  server_addr = x.x.x.x
  server_port = 7000
  auth_token = 123

  [web]
  type = http
  local_port = 80
  ```

4. Start frpc:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.ini`

5. Resolve A record of `www.yourdomain.com` to IP `x.x.x.x` or CNAME record to your origin domain.

6. Now visit your local web service using url `http://www.yourdomain.com:8080`.

### Forward DNS query request

1. Modify frps.ini, configure a reverse proxy named [dns]:

  ```ini
  # frps.ini
  [common]
  bind_port = 7000

  [dns]
  type = udp
  listen_port = 6000
  auth_token = 123
  ```

2. Start frps:

  `./frps -c ./frps.ini`

3. Modify frpc.ini, set remote frps's server IP as x.x.x.x, forward dns query request to google dns server `8.8.8.8:53`:

  ```ini
  # frpc.ini
  [common]
  server_addr = x.x.x.x
  server_port = 7000
  auth_token = 123

  [dns]
  type = udp
  local_ip = 8.8.8.8
  local_port = 53
  ```

4. Start frpc:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.ini`

5. Send dns query request by dig:

  `dig @x.x.x.x -p 6000 www.goolge.com`

## Features

### Dashboard

Check frp's status and proxies's statistics information by Dashboard.

Configure a port for dashboard to enable this feature:

```ini
[common]
dashboard_port = 7500
# dashboard's username and password are both optional，if not set, default is admin.
dashboard_user = admin
dashboard_pwd = admin
```

Then visit `http://[server_addr]:7500` to see dashboard, default username and password are both `admin`.

![dashboard](/doc/pic/dashboard.png)

### Authentication

`auth_token` in frps.ini is configured for each proxy and check for authentication when frpc login in.

Client that want's to register must set a global `auth_token` equals to frps.ini.

Note that time duration between frpc and frps mustn't exceed 15 minutes because timestamp is used for authentication.

Howerver, this timeout duration can be modified by setting `authentication_timeout` in frps's configure file. It's defalut value is 900, means 15 minutes. If it is equals 0, then frps will not check authentication timeout.

### Encryption and Compression

Defalut value is false, you could decide if the proxy will use encryption or compression whether the type is:

```ini
# frpc.ini
[ssh]
type = tcp
listen_port = 6000
auth_token = 123
use_encryption = true
use_gzip = true
```

### Reload configures without frps stopped

If you want to add a new reverse proxy and avoid restarting frps, you can use this function:

1. `dashboard_port` should be set in frps.ini:

  ```ini
  # frps.ini
  [common]
  bind_port = 7000
  dashboard_port = 7500
  ```

2. Start frps:

  `./frps -c ./frps.ini`

3. Modify frps.ini to add a new proxy [new_ssh]:

  ```ini
  # frps.ini
  [common]
  bind_port = 7000
  dashboard_port = 7500

  [new_ssh]
  listen_port = 6001
  auth_token = 123
  ```

4. Execute `reload` command:

  `./frps -c ./frps.ini --reload`

5. Start frpc and [new_ssh] is available now.

### Privilege Mode

Privilege mode is used for who don't want to do operations in frps everytime adding a new proxy.

All proxies's configurations are set in frpc.ini when privilege mode is enabled.

1. Enable privilege mode and set `privilege_token`.Client with the same `privilege_token` can create proxy automaticly:

  ```ini
  # frps.ini
  [common]
  bind_port = 7000
  privilege_mode = true
  privilege_token = 1234
  ```

2. Start frps:

  `./frps -c ./frps.ini`

3. Enable privilege mode for proxy [ssh]:

  ```ini
  # frpc.ini
  [common]
  server_addr = x.x.x.x
  server_port = 7000
  privilege_token = 1234

  [ssh]
  privilege_mode = true
  local_port = 22
  remote_port = 6000
  ```

4. Start frpc:

  `./frpc -c ./frpc.ini`

5. Connect to server in LAN by ssh assuming username is test:

  `ssh -oPort=6000 test@x.x.x.x`

#### Port White List

`privilege_allow_ports` in frps.ini is used for preventing abuse of ports in privilege mode:

```ini
# frps.ini
[common]
privilege_mode = true
privilege_token = 1234
privilege_allow_ports = 2000-3000,3001,3003,4000-50000
```

`privilege_allow_ports` consists of a specific port or a range of ports divided by `,`.

### Connection Pool

By default, frps send message to frpc for create a new connection to backward service when getting an user request.If a proxy's connection pool is enabled, there will be a specified number of connections pre-established.

This feature is fit for a large number of short connections.

1. Configure the limit of pool count each proxy can use in frps.ini:

  ```ini         
  # frps.ini
  [common]
  max_pool_count = 50
  ```

2. Enable and specify the number of connection pool:

  ```ini
  # frpc.ini
  [ssh]
  type = tcp
  local_port = 22
  pool_count = 10
  ```

### Rewriting the Host Header

When forwarding to a local port, frp does not modify the tunneled HTTP requests at all, they are copied to your server byte-for-byte as they are received. Some application servers use the Host header for determining which development site to display. For this reason, frp can rewrite your requests with a modified Host header. Use the `host_header_rewrite` switch to rewrite incoming HTTP requests.

```ini                                                             
# frpc.ini                                                         
[web]
privilege_mode = true
type = http
local_port = 80
custom_domains = test.yourdomain.com
host_header_rewrite = dev.yourdomain.com
```

If `host_header_rewrite` is specified, the Host header will be rewritten to match the hostname portion of the forwarding address.

### Password protecting your web service

Anyone who can guess your tunnel URL can access your local web server unless you protect it with a password.

This enforces HTTP Basic Auth on all requests with the username and password you specify in frpc's configure file.

It can be only enabled when proxy type is http.

```ini
# frpc.ini
[web]
privilege_mode = true
type = http
local_port = 80
custom_domains = test.yourdomain.com
http_user = abc
http_pwd = abc
```

Visit `test.yourdomain.com` and now you need to input username and password.

### Custom subdomain names

It is convenient to use `subdomain` configure for http、https type when many people use one frps server together.

```ini
# frps.ini
subdomain_host = frps.com
```

Resolve `*.frps.com` to the frps server's IP.

```ini
# frpc.ini
[web]
privilege_mode = true
type = http
local_port = 80
subdomain = test
```

Now you can visit your web service by host `test.frps.com`.

Note that if `subdomain_host` is not empty, `custom_domains` should not be the subdomain of `subdomain_host`.

### URL routing

frp support forward http requests to different backward web services by url routing.

`locations` specify the prefix of URL used for routing. frps first searches for the most specific prefix location given by literal strings regardless of the listed order.

```ini
# frpc.ini
[web01]
privilege_mode = true
type = http
local_port = 80
custom_domains = web.yourdomain.com
locations = /

[web02]
privilege_mode = true
type = http
local_port = 81
custom_domains = web.yourdomain.com
locations = /news,/about
```
Http requests with url prefix `/news` and `/about` will be forwarded to **web02** and others to **web01**.

### Connect frps by HTTP PROXY

frpc can connect frps using HTTP PROXY if you set os environment `HTTP_PROXY` or configure `http_proxy` param in frpc.ini file.

```ini
# frpc.ini
server_addr = x.x.x.x
server_port = 7000
http_proxy = http://user:pwd@192.168.1.128:8080
```

## Development Plan

* Log http request information in frps.
* Direct reverse proxy, like haproxy.
* Load balance to different service in frpc.
* Debug mode for frpc, prestent proxy status in terminal.
* Inspect all http requests/responses that are transmitted over the tunnel.
* Frpc can directly be a webserver for static files.
* Full control mode, dynamically modify frpc's configure with dashboard in frps.
* P2p communicate by make udp hole to penetrate NAT.
